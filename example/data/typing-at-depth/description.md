⏰ This was made in 72 hours for [Ludum Dare 57 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57/ld57-2).

*   We did not create Clippy ([source](https://tenor.com/search/microsoft-clippy-gifs)).
*   Nor did we create the gorgeous Courier Prime font ([source](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Courier+Prime)).
*   Everything else is pure, unfiltered, and fresh-squeezed originality (includes pulp!).
