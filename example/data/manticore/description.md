_[Manticore Games](https://www.manticoregames.com/) is a video game company based in San Mateo, California._

-   Massive impact on our codebase: **Created 25% of the CLs** (of 20 devs), while accounting for only 5% of the bugs.
-   Extensive work on: networking, engine, UI architecture (both UMG and Slate), Blueprints, matchmaking, game-loading, inventory systems, UGC systems (authoring / dynamic-loading / in-game-usage), editor tooling, C++/Lua script-binding, telemetry and performance optimization.
-   Specific impact:
    -   Drove adoption of Unreal’s **ViewModel framework**—yielding **3x speed-up for UI creation and maintenance**.
    -   Added **telemetry tools** and introduced **object-pooling**, to **optimize performance of critical gameplay features by 2x to 30x**.
    -   Architected **configurable UI layout systems**, which let devs **create new overlays 4x as quickly**.
    -   Designed a **Hierarchical State Machine**, which **halved the bugs** in a complex matchmaking system.
    -   Implemented an **event-logging system**, which let devs debug issues in published servers **10x as quickly**.
    -   Designed **developer tooling** to let QA and devs test issues in the most Critical User Journeys in **half the time** (e.g. a teleport system and a     -   UGC-management system).
    -   Improved **Bounding Box calculation** **accuracy by 2x** and **efficiency by 3x**.
    -   Introduced **automated testing practices** across engineering teams.
    -   Created **robust tweening libraries**, in both Lua and Blueprints, enabling animations of any property.
    -   And many other systems that are under NDA!
