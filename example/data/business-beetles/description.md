> Welcome to your first day as the CEO of Business Beetles! Lead your tiny beetle employee-servants by hiring recruiter beetles, raising revenue by selling your products, and employing guards who can defend you from the bird mafia (who may be out to collect on some unpaid loans the company might have failed to pay back). 
> 
> Try your best to keep the mini-corporation's profits high! (or at the very least, try your best to keep it profitable...hopefully...)
