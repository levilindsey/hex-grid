> 🍬🫧 The age-old story of blowing an overly ambitious bubble and being carried away to lands unknown.

🎙️ This game is controlled using only your microphone!

⏰ This was made in 48 hours for [Global Game Jam 2025](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2025/oh-places-youll-blow-7).

🐞 The Windows build has the fewest issues. On Android, we have sometimes seen issues with the audio input cutting out after half a minute or so.

⭐ The theme for the jam was "Bubble".
