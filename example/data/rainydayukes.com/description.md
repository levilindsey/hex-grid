_[Rainy Day Ukes][main-url] was a web-based handmade ukulele business._

Levi built this website for his friend's business. It was originally hosted at rainydayukes.com, but has since been taken down. However, you can still check out the site on the [WayBack Machine][main-url].  

All designs were done by the supremely talented visual designer [Ryan Maher][ryan-url].
