## Global Game Jam 2021

This game was created as a submission for [Global Game Jam 2021](https://globalgamejam.org/2021/games/ooboloo-2). All design, code, images, sound effects, and music were created in under 48 hours.

### The theme: "Lost and found"

The theme for the game jam was "lost and found". This game addresses the theme by having the player collect little bits of themselves that are scattered around the level, but while doing so the player also loses bits of themselves.
