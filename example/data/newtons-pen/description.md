#### An Intelligent Tutoring System running on Window's tablets

In his graduate studies at the University of California, Riverside, Levi worked with Professor
[Thomas Stahovich][stahovich-url] in the [Smart Tools lab][stl-url].

Levi led the development of a statics tutorial system, which both helped novice students tackle difficult concepts and
provided the lab with key insights into the learning process and how students think.

This work resulted in the production of two completely different software programs: one which ran on tablet PC
computers with a standard computer interface (_written in C# with WPF_), and one which ran on
[Livescribe smartpens][livescribe-url] with specially designed paper worksheets (_written in Java_). Both programs
were designed with natural user interface as a paramount concern. These programs were deployed to 150 students in an
introductory statics course at the University of California, Riverside in the Winter of 2012.
