_Descend out of the darkness in our first-person atmospheric game._

> _**[Play the game!](https://levilindsey.itch.io/the-before-times)**_

This is a game about exploring an infinitely looping room and getting out of a dark place.
It's short, very atmospheric, with great art, a really great music progression, and great voice overs!
