#### A general-purpose photo-viewer application

This fancy web app is loaded with bells and whistles. A smattering of them includes:

- Expandable, animated photo grids, which display large collections of photo thumbnails
- A lightbox for conveniently viewing and navigating through medium-sized versions of the images
- Full-screen mode for viewing and navigating through the original, full-sized versions of the images
- A very flashy SVG-based progress circle
- Use of the XHR2 progress event for displaying the download progress of larger images

This app was originally built to show off the photos from Levi and [Jackie's][jackie-url] wedding.
