#### A progress circle built using SVG

The progress circle consists of a ring of color-shifting dots.

Specifically, the dots revolve in a clockwise direction while the colors of the dots transition in such a way to make the colors appear to transition in a counter-clockwise direction.

This project uses a separate custom animation package Levi developed.
