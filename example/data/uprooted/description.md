_This is a 3D first-person shooter._

> You are a walking tree, and you must survive as long as you can through endless waves of wood-cutting robots. In order to defend yourself, you must place roots near a pool of fresh spring water. But these springs are fickle, and they constantly dry-up, so you must keep uprooting yourself in search of fresh water and safety.

All design and code were created during the jam. Some art, models, music, and sfx were borrowed from other sources.
