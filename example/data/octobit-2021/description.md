* [Latte art](https://www.facebook.com/groups/552152208714234/?multi_permalinks=939026753360109)
    * Apparently, this latte art looks like male genitalia, and the Internet thinks that's hilarious.
    * "looks really good! the shading is nice, and you even got the foam dissipating into the coffee! i won't point out what's already been pointed out a thousand times, though..."
* [Robot](https://www.facebook.com/groups/552152208714234/?multi_permalinks=944205039508947)
    * "I JUST got a robot vacuum yesterday and have strongly bonded to him already. Funny to see this lol... I've named him Dinkleburg."
