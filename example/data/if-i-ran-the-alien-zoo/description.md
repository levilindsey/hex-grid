## An action alien-abduction game! 👽🛸


> There are lots of interesting Earthlings out there. Gotta catch 'em all!

⏰ This was made in 72 hours for the [Ludum Dare 58 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/58/if-i-ran-the-alien-zoo).

⭐ The theme for the jam was "Collector".

For this one, I made a level with infite scroll, a region-based Earthling-spawner system, a complex detection system with nuanced police chasing and flashlight behaviors, and lots of fun pixel art.

We created all sounds, art, code, everything in this game from scratch.
