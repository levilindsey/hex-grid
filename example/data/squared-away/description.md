This web app gave Levi the opportunity to hone his web development skills and to learn the latest features of
HTML5 and CSS3.

On the front end, Levi used pure JavaScript without external libraries like jQuery&mdash;with the notable exception of
SoundJS for cross-browser support for layering audio. On the server side, Levi used Node.js with ExpressJS.
