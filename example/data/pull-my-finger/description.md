_A top-down, 2D game where you harness the incredible power of beans to stave off hoards of admirers who are inexplicably attracted to you._

> Prepare yourself for epic music and foul farts. No win condition currently - see how far you can get!

Featuring:
-   A ridiculously **over-the-top soundtrack**.
-   Classy **AI-powered voiceovers**.
-   Only a very tasteful sprinkling of **gratuitous fart humor**.

## The jam

This game was created in 48-hours as a [submission](https://globalgamejam.org/games/2024/pull-my-finger-bean-based-survival-game-6) for the [2024 Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/).

**Theme: "Make me laugh"**

It's completely the theme's fault that we were obligated to rely on so much fart humor. Our hands were tied...
