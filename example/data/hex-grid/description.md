#### A dynamic, expandable, animated grid of hexagonal tiles for displaying posts

_See this running at [www.jackieandlevi.com/hex-grid][demo-url]!_

I was bored with the standard grid layout and wanted to play with particle systems and crazy animations. So I made
hex-grid.

## Features

Some features of this package include:

- A particle system complete with neighbor and anchor position spring dynamics
- An assortment of **persistent** animations that make the grid _exciting to watch_
- An assortment of **transient** animations that make the grid _exciting to interact with_
- A control panel that enables you to adjust most of the many different parameters of this system
- The ability to display custom collections of posts
    - These posts will be displayed within individual tiles
    - These tile posts can be drilled down into for more information
    - The contents of these posts use standard [Markdown syntax][markdown-url], which is then parsed by the system for
      displaying within the grid
