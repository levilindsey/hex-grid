This point-and-click platformer game showcases procedural pathfinding using the [Surfacer](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/surfacer/) framework.

In this game, the user can click anywhere in the level, and the cat character will then jump, walk, and climb across platforms in order to reach that target destination.
