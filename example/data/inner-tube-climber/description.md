This is an endless climber game, with fun wall bouncing!

_**[Ludum Dare 47 submission](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/stuck-in-an-inner-tube/)**_

This game was originally a "Compo" submission for the [Ludum Dare 47 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/stuck-in-an-inner-tube/). All design, code, images, sound effects, and music were created by Levi in under 48 hours. This game rated in the 90th percentile for "Overall", "Fun", "Graphics", "Audio", and "Humor" (and in the 95th percentile for "Fun"!). The creation of this game was also [livestreamed on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ukulelefury/videos).

Levi later added more features to the game and re-released it as a mobile app.

### The theme: "Stuck in a loop"

The theme for the game jam was "stuck in a loop". This game addresses the theme in two ways:
1.  The player is stuck inside a "loop"--that is, their inner tube--from a tragic inner-tubing accident.
2.  The vertically-scrolling level has no end, it "loops" through previous platforms if you get far enough.
