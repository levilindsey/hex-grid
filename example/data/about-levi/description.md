With a strong background as an applications engineer across a wide array of platforms, Levi specializes in full-stack
web development.

Levi develops with an emphasis on modular, maintainable, and self-documented code. He takes pride in his work and
strives to design all of his projects to be intuitive and "easy on the eyes"&mdash;both from an outward-facing user
perspective and from an internal code-level perspective.

Levi constantly pushes the envelope with new and exciting ideas for web applications. He thrives on learning new
technologies and methodologies with each new project he undertakes.
