_"I write code. I sing songs. I create things."_

Levi is a Software Engineer. He sometimes makes exciting games. He sometimes makes complicated websites. He's constantly tinkering on game-dev side projects&mdash;which are all highlighted in this portfolio.

Levi is originally from Olympia, WA. He was in California for a bit, and he now lives in Seattle, WA with his wife Jackie and their daughter.

Outside the realm of computer science, Levi has many hobbies and interests. First and foremost, he is a musician. Levi is a classically trained singer and has led in many operas and musicals; some of his more notable performances include: [Dido and Aeneas][dido-and-aeneas-url] (Aeneas), [Savitri][savitri-url] (Satyavan), and [My Fair Lady][my-fair-lady-url] (Henry Higgins). Levi also [sings with a capella groups][love-like-you-url] and [plays a lot of ukulele][down-today-url]. Check out some of his [recordings on YouTube][youtube-url]!

Some of his other hobbies include: pottery, laser-cutting, brewing beer, blacksmithing, scuba diving, gardening, baking, board games/card games, and a never-ending list of home improvements.
