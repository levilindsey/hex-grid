#### A blind-accessible route-navigation Android application

In a computer science capstone course on accessibility at the University of Washington, Levi co-developed a
route-orienting application that would guide a blind user via vibrational feedback.

This application would first geocode the user's current location and a user-entered destination and then query the
Google Directions API for a route from the one to the other. This route was then displayed on a map with the userâ€™s
current location. The user could then rotate the phone around, and the phone would vibrate when pointed in the
direction of the current step in the user's route.

This involved the creation of a completely novel blind-accessible soft keyboard in addition to the implementation of a
database for storing previously entered destinations.
