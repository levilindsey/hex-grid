#### Fun with SVG, balls, and bouncing!

This is a project in which Levi played around with balls and bouncing. This is just for fun, so enjoy!

The color of each ball is always shifting to another random value. At any given point, the hue, saturation, and lightness components of the ball colors are each constrained to a random global range. This creates an interesting effect with independently fluctuating colors that almost always seem cohesive.
