Levi left Google to pursue his passion of game development. He spent a year and a half doing solo game development using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) and making 2D platformers.

In particular, if you're curious about Levi's motivations and goals for his sabbatical, check out [his first post](https://devlog.levi.dev/2021/01/wait-what-am-i-doing.html).
