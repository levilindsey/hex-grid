## 📱 The mobile app

I am currently extending the Ludum Dare version of Meteor Power into a more-polished mobile version.

-   It should be released late June.
-   You can follow my progress at [devlog.levi.dev](https://devlog.levi.dev).
-   This extended version is also [open-source on GitHub](https://github.com/SnoringCatGames/meteor_power).


## ‍💻 The jam

**Theme: "Delay the inevitable"**

Ludum Dare is a semi-annual event where people create a game over the weekend. Ludum Dare is a ranked competition, with a clever voting system that gets more eyes on your game when you in turn rate other games. There are two tracks you can participate in:

-   In the "**Compo**" track, you must create all your own art, music, sounds, etc. from scratch, work by yourself, and finish within 48 hours.
-   In the "**Jam**" track, you can work with a team, you can use art, code, music, sounds, etc. that already existed or was created by someone else, and you get 72 hours to finish.

Additionally, the games all follow some central theme, which is only announced at the start of the jam.

I worked solo and created everything during the event. Except of course for my Scaffolder and Surfacer frameworks (which is fine, you're allowed to use pre-existing code).


## 🎮 Controls

-   Mouse and keyboard.
-   A/S/D/Q/W/E to select a bot.
