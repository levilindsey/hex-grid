A smattering of them includes:\n\n- Expandable, animated photo grids, which display large collections of photo thumbnails\n- A lightbox for conveniently viewing and navigating through medium-sized versions of the images\n- Full-screen mode for viewing and navigating through the original, full-sized versions of the images\n- A very flashy SVG-based progress circle\n- Use of the XHR2 progress event for displaying the download progress of larger images\n\nThis app was originally built to show off the photos from Levi and [Jackie's][jackie-url] wedding.\n\n\n[main-url]: http:\/\/jackieandlevi.com\/wedding\/photos\n[jackie-url]: http:\/\/jackieandlevi.com\/jackie"
